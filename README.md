# Boid-Flock
A university project about modelling boid flocking behaviour


This project was designed as part of a university course on data structures and algorithms. The focus was on
modelling boid behaviour by using linked lists in conjunction with threads. The framework of the programs was 
provided to us, with the requirements being that we implemented the boid movement, drawing and displaying.

The program can be downloaded and run using any local Java environment such as Apache NetBeans.
