# Boid-Flock
A university project about modelling boid flocking behaviour


This project was designed as part of a university course on data structures and algorithims. The focus was on
modeling boid behaviour by using linked lists in conjunction with threads. The framework of the programs was 
provided to us, with the requirments being that we implemented the boid movement,drawing and displaying.

The program can be downloaded and run in the package using any suitable Java ide.
